"I recently developed an engaging Rock, Paper, Scissors game using computer vision and hand tracking. 
Leveraging OpenCV and the CVZone library, the game allows players to make moves with hand gestures, competing against an AI opponent. 
The game features a dynamic background and real-time scoring, providing an immersive and enjoyable experience. 
It was a fun project that combines programming, computer vision, and game development.
Check out the code and a demo on my GitHub, and feel free to reach out for more details!
